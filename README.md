# SFO Gene Browser

This repository contains an open-source, interactive gene browser built to explore our extended single-cell RNA-seq data from the subfornical organ (SFO) under distinct thirst conditions.  

This app contains data from the following publications.

- **The cellular basis of distinct thirst modalities**  
  Allan-Hermann Pool, Tongtong Wang, David A. Stafford, Rebecca K. Chance, Sangjun Lee, John Ngai & Yuki Oka. *Nature*, 2020  

- **Parallel neural pathways control sodium consumption and taste valence**  
  Yameng Zhang, Allan-Hermann Pool, Tongtong Wang, Lu Liu, Elin Kang, Bei Zhang, Liang Ding, Kirsten Frieda, Richard Palmiter & Yuki Oka. *Cell*, 2023  

The browser is designed to be plug-and-play, so other labs can adapt the data processing and analysis steps to host and share their own multi-condition transcriptomic datasets stored in .h5ad format.
